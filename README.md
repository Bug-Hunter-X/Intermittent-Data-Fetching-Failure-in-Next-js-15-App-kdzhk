# Intermittent Data Fetching Failure in Next.js 15 App

This repository demonstrates an intermittent data fetching issue encountered in a Next.js 15 application. The `About` page fetches data from an API route (`/api/data`), but occasionally fails to display the data, remaining stuck on a "Loading..." state.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the Next.js development server.
4. Navigate to `/about`.
5. Observe that sometimes the data is displayed correctly, while other times the page remains stuck on "Loading...".

## Potential Causes

The cause of this issue is under investigation but may be related to:

- **Caching issues:**  The browser may be caching a stale response.
- **API route timing:** The API route might sometimes respond slower than expected.
- **Data fetching lifecycle:**  Potential inconsistencies in the lifecycle of `useEffect` hook.

## Solution (in `about.js` and `data.js`)

The solution often involves adding error handling and retry mechanisms to make data fetching more robust, though, in this instance, we are simply ensuring a minimal consistent response.
